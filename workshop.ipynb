        "The linear and quadratic programming problems MICOM has to solve are very large and very complicated. There are some very good commercial solvers that are very expensive (even though they are often free for academic use). To make this tutorial as accessible as possible we will use the Open Source solver [OSQP](https://osqp.org/). OSQP is amazing with quadratic programming problems (kudos!) but not as accurate for linear problems. Solvers usually only guarantee a solution within a certain numerical tolerance of the real solution. In order to make everything work with OSQP this tolerance has to be relaxed to about 10<sup>-3</sup>. This means that any result with an absolute value smaller than that might very well be zero so we should look at larger values only. Installing cost-free academic versions of commercial solvers like [IBM CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) or [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) would alow you to lower the tolerance to 10<sup>-6</sup>.\n",
